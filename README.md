# Exploring-sales-trends-and-customer-segmentation-in-online-retail
Despite the growing popularity of online retail, many businesses struggle to fully understand their customer behavior and preferences. In this project I aimed to explore the retail dataset in order to:

1. Perform statistical analysis to identify key patterns and trends in customer purchasing behavior
2. Perform some hypothesis testing using basic statistical tests
3. Perform clustering of customers in terms of product purchases, geographical location etc. 
4. Use LOF to try identify anomalous customer behavior
